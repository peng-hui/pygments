Adding line numbers to richtext (rtf) format (and importing to power point).
===================
1. The line numbers are shown in black color (RGB(0,0,0)). This is done by modifying ``pygments/formatters/rtf.py``.
2. To avoid the conflict with the mainstream Pygments package, I modified the package name when installing it. In particular, the ``Pygments`` becomes ``Pygments1``; the ``pygmentize`` becomes ``pygmentize1``.
3. To install, just run ``python setup.py install``. See ``setup.cfg`` for more details.

On MacOS, to generate highlighted code in richtext and insert into power point, you can use ``pygmentize1 -f rtf FILE.php | pbcopy``, then you paste to TextEdit. Recopy the content from TextEdit and finally paste to power point. That's it [1].

Bugs: 
1. Code comments are usually in italic style. When a comment lies at the end of a line, and the next line starts with intents, the line number of the next line migit be italic style also. This is because the line end character and the intents (tabs or spaces) in the next line consists of one token in Pygments. Therefore, the line number I insert is also rendered with the local italic style.
